Jenkins master/agent model:
--------------------------
*steps to install & configure agent server:
------------------------------------------
 
1)create a ubuntu server

2)create a user in agent server

3)update password to the user

4)modify sshd config file in server

5)Restart SSHD services

6)Give full permissions to user

7)install java latest version on agent server
  

8)integrate agent with master by using user based authentication
   in Jenkins master login -> Dashboard -> manage Jenkins -> nodes -> create new node -> node name(slave1) -> select permanent agent -> keep some default and give some following steps 
-> remote root directory (/home/shiva)-> labels (slave1) -> lunch method (lunch agent via ssh) -> host (IP address of the agent server) -> credentials (add your agent server user with id) 
-> host key verification strategy (non verifying verification strategy) -> save

9)install git latest version on agent server
 
10)create a job on master and run job on agent for that run a job 
-->dashboard --> new item (name of the item)--> free style project -> select git with git repository URL --> build steps --> invoke top-level maven target-->maven version (maven3.6.9) 
--> goals (clean install package) --> save   ==> while run a job it runs in master node we want to run in slave for that -->click on job id go to configure in that general tab tick the restrict where this project can be run --> label expression (master or node id) then save it
