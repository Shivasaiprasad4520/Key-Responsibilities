----------------------------------------------------

Linux: basic commands -:
=====================
 -> user management, swap management, sim link, hard link, dics management, process management, services management, AWS Volume, NFS, file system

cd /opt
df -h
lsblk
lsblk -f
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdx
ll
mkdir data
ll
mount /dev/xvdd /opt/data
df -h
cat /etc/fstab



logic volume management-:
==============
LVM  Architecture :
       |
       v 
Physical Hard Disks  (its a volume or Disk of the Server and it is a default one)
       |
       v
 Physical Volume     (in this we create a physical volume from the disk, in this we actually create one or use multiply volume )
       |              cmd: pvcreate
       v
  Volume Group       (in this we sum up the physical volume into a group then we call it as a group volume, we can add multiply volume into one group)
       |              cmd: vgcreate
       v
  Logical Group      (in this we will divide into multiply volume from group volume)
       |               cmd: lvcreate
       v
  File system        (in this we create log file or install software in it )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to check the disk in vm we use and it show case that raw disk
cmd: parted -l

listing in block state
cmd: lsblk

to create physical volume 
cmd: pvcreate /dev/sdb or c,d,e,f

to check the physical volume created or not 
cmd: pvs  and cmd: pvdisplay (if we use this command we can see in depth)

to create a volume group
cmd: vgcreate volg_1 /dev/sbd /dev/sdc     [vgcreate+"nameofthevolumegroup"+"/dev/sdc"] if u want to add one more volume then [vgcreate+"nameofthevolumegroup"+"/dev/sdc" "/dev/sdb"]

to check the volume group created or not
cmd: vgs or vgs -v

to create logic volume 
cmd: lvcreate -L 4G -n logvol_1 volg_1     [lvcreate -L +"howmuch-GB-allocate" -n+nameofthelogicalvolume+volumegroupname]

to check the volume group created or not
cmd: lvs

in previous step 1 logical volume created now we want to format that logical volume then mount on a directory for that we make file system
cmd: mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg

cmd: mkfs.ext4 /dev/vlog_1/logvol_1         [mkfs.ext4 /dev/+groupvolume+logicalvolume]

cmd: partprobe      {this cmd is for what thinks are going in system that are to update to kernel:}

to mount logic volume to particular directory named as shiva
cmd: mount /dev/volg_1/logvol_1 /shiva/

to check that is mounted or not
cmd: df -h

to watch directory we use following cmd
cmd: watch df -h /dev/mapper/vlog_1-logvol_1     [df -h + pathnameofdirectory]

now if logical file system is full then we want extend to the existing one
cmd: lvextend -L+5G /dev/vlog-1/logvol-1

to update file system we resize the directory
cmd: resize2fs /dev/mapper/volg-1/logvol-1
------------------------------------
snapshot:
to create a snapshot for a volume or file
cmd: lvcreate -s -n sai_snapshot -L 1G /dev/mapper/vlog_1-logvol_1
     [lvcreate -s for snapshot -n for name sai_snapshot -L 1G how much gb for snapshot + path of the file]

to merge the snapshot to original logical volume
cm: lvconvert --mergesnapshot /dev/vlog-1/sai_snapshot

to reterive the data we should deactivate and activate then the data will update
cmd: umount /shiva/
cmd: lvchange -an /dev/mapper/vlog_1-logvol_1    --> deactivate
cmd: lvchange -ay /dev/mapper/vlog_1-logvol_1    --> activate
cmd: mount /dev/mapper/vlog_1-logvol_1 /shiva/


----------------
*why we use LVM ?
#) in our file system when we make a partition to a volume or disk then the one of the partitioned volume is fulled, then we extend the space in the partitioned through Logical volume and if space is there in other partitioned volume we can use that with the help of  sink . if in case partitioned volume is filled then we create a physical hard disk and allocate that if its root or home or anywhere we can allocate

physical volume  --cmd pvcreate /dev/xvdd
volume group     --cmd vgcreate gem /dev/xvdd
logical volume   --cmd lvcreate -n jam -l gam 

cmd: pvcreate /dev/xvdd
cmd:

1)command mode: move cursor top to buttom and left to right:
----------------------------------------------------------
delete line                   dd
undo line                     u
copy                          yy
paste                          p
mv cursor word by word         w
mv cursor back word by word    b

         i  -->to switch insert mode modify the content
         
3)extended command mode:

user management:
---------------

useradd/adduser --> to add/create user
passwd username --> to add passwd to user
vi /etc/sudoers --> to give primission to the user
su username   --> to switch user
exit  --> to exit from user

file permissions:
----------------
permissions are applied on 3 levels
1) Owner/user level
2) Group level
3)Other level
Access Modes are 3 types:

1) r  read
2) w  write
3) x excute

The permission string - ---(u) ---(g) ---(o) can be interpreted as follows: 
 
The first character (-) indicates that file is a regular file (not a directory or 
special file). 
The next three characters (---) represent the permissions for the user owner 
(user). Since all permissions are set to ---, the user owner has no permissions. 
The next three characters (---) represent the permissions for the group owner 
(user group). Similarly, all permissions are set to ---, meaning the group owner 
has no permissions. 
The last three characters (---) represent the permissions for other users. Once 
again, all permissions are set to ---, indicating that other users have no 
permissions.

-->ls
-->ls -l filename (it showcase the file with default permission)
-->chmod u=w,g=w,o=w filename (it will changes from default permission to write premission)

2 Absolute method:we use nubers in place of rwx

1) 4  read
2) 2  write
3) 1 execute
    421(u)421(g)421(o)
-->chmod 666(u+g+o) filename (it will changes from default permission to read&write premission)
